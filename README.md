<h1 align="center">üåø dotfiles</h1>

Welcome devs! Here you'll find all the configuration files that power my development environment, meticulously curated to provide an efficient, productive, and aesthetically pleasing setup.

> [!NOTE]
> I‚Äôm using WSL2 for my development environment. <br/>
> If you encounter any issues related to file permissions, symbolic links, or path configurations, please keep in mind that WSL2 may behave differently compared to a native Linux environment. You might need to adjust certain configurations accordingly.

## üõ†Ô∏è Core
- **Zsh**: `.zshrc`, for custom aliases, functions, and prompt customization.
- **Neovim (NvChad)**: Full configuration for [NvChad](https://nvchad.com/) stored in `.config/nvim`, featuring a plugin-rich environment.
- **Tmux**: `.config/tmux/.tmux.conf`, with key bindings and session management for an efficient terminal workflow.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ashish0kumar/dotfiles.git
    cd dotfiles
    ```

2. **Install GNU Stow**:
    - On Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt install stow`
    - On macOS: `brew install stow`

3. **Symlink the configurations**:
    ```bash
    stow .
    ```

4. **Install NvChad**:
    If NvChad isn‚Äôt already installed, clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/NvChad/NvChad ~/.config/nvim --depth 1
    ```

    - Your custom configurations should be placed under `~/.config/nvim/lua/custom/` (for key mappings, options, etc.).
    - NvChad uses [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) for plugin management.


## üöÄ Usage
After symlinking, the configurations will be applied automatically when you restart your terminal or application. To apply changes, reload or source the files:
- Zsh: `source ~/.zshrc`
- Tmux: `tmux source ~/.tmux.conf`
- NvChad: Restart Neovim or run `:Lazy sync` inside Neovim to sync plugins using **lazy.nvim**.


## üîó Stow Guide
GNU Stow is used to manage symlinks for these configuration files. Each subdirectory of the repo contains the dotfiles for a specific application, and Stow handles linking these to your home directory. 

- To symlink a config:
  ```bash
  stow <folder>
  ```

- To remove a symlinked config:

  ```bash
  stow -D <folder>
  ```

## üìú License

Feel free to use and modify these dotfiles to suit your needs.
